# rotating_sphere
This is the repository for an experiment that is used to investigate the ambiguity of the rotating sphere illusion.


## TODO

- load_next_during_phase --> set this to 0, then we can load the trial during the break 
- improve naming of the previous frames indices (e.g. ambiguous_last_frame_previous is way too long and unclear)
