Task settings: 
    Response interval: [0.1, 1.5] # time in s you allow the participant to respond that still counts as correct response (only relevant for unambiguous stimuli)
    Blocks: 4 # e.g. 2 blocks would be one that starts with ambiguous and one that starts with unambiguous.
    Blocks practice: 2 # can be interrupted after every block - alternating ambiguous and unambiguous, ambiguous is always first 
    Previous percept duration: 3 # in s, mean of percept duration from previous studies (used to determine duration of unambiguos trials)
    Percept duration jitter: 0.5 # in s, added to the previous percept duration (0.1 would be a random UNIFORM jitter between -0.1 and 0.1)
    Stimulus duration ambiguous: 10 # 120 # (2mins) duration in s
    Break duration: 5 # duration in s (this is between the trials AND blocks)
