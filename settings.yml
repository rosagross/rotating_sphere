    Blocks: 4 # e.g. 2 blocks would be one that starts with ambiguous and one that starts with unambiguous.
    Blocks practice: 2 # can be interrupted after every block - alternating ambiguous and unambiguous, ambiguous is always first

    Percept duration jitter: 0.5 # in s, added to the previous percept duration (0.1 would be a random UNIFORM jitter between -0.1 and 0.1)
